Prob 1:
    Find the country and quarter with the highest percentage change and that
    with the lowest precentage change. Some countries are missing data for some 
    quarters (the entry for that quarter is blank), so these missing quarters 
    should be ignored.

The highest quarterly percentage change of any country and quarter was 21.58 % for IRL in 2015-Q1
The lowest quarterly percentage change of any country and quarter was -9.15 % for EST in 2008-Q4

Prob2:
    For each quarter, take the average of the changes in GDP across all countries 
    (ignoring blank entries). Find the quarter with the highest average change and 
    the quarter with the lowest average change.

The quarter with the highest average change is 1997-Q2 at 1.58 %
The quarter with the lowest average change is 2009-Q1 at -2.69 %

Prob 3:
    Find the cumulative percentage change for each country. To do so, start with 1 and 
    for each quarter (that isn't blank) multiply it by (1 + change/100). Eg, the first two 
    changes for Greece (GRC) are 0.575928 and 1.69888, so the cumulative change is 
    1 * (1 + 0.575928/100) * (1 + 1.69888/100) = 1.0228, or +2.28 %. Rank each country 
    according to its cumulative change in GDP.

Prob 4:
    Calculate the cumulative percentage change in GDP for all countries 
    for quarters up to and including 2006-Q4, and likewise for quarters from 
    2007-Q1 onwards. Rank each country according to the difference between 
    the cumulative changes in the later and earlier time periods. Some countries 
    have no entries prior to 2007, so these countries should be skipped.

Differences in cumulative GDP change before and after 2007-Q1 :
